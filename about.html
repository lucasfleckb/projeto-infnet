  <h2>Former Infantry Soldier</h2>
   <p>I served two years in the Army, stationed in the Infantry, where I participated in various civic exercises,
    improvement exercises, and ensuring law and order. I was transferred from the operational company to the administrative sector,
    where I worked in the procurement and bidding department and developed a certain interest in the field.</p>

  <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
   <p>Currently, I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at Unisinos, and to boost my career, I'm doing a full-stack web development
    bootcamp at Infnet, so that I can be prepared for the job market before completing my course.</p>

   <h2>Dog and AI lover</h2>
   <p>The correlation between my love for dogs and their interest in artificial intelligence may not seem obvious at first glance. However, 
    the emotional connection and loyalty between a person and their furry friend can provide insight into the way humans interact with machines. 
    The development of intelligent machines that can learn and adapt to their surroundings requires a deep understanding of human behavior and emotions, 
    just like the bond between a dog and their owner. As we continue to advance in technology, the similarities between the two become more apparent,
    with both requiring empathy and a strong connection to truly thrive.</p>

  <h2>Eternal Optimist</h2>
   <p>I recently read the book "Luck Follows Courage" by Mario Sergio Cortella during a difficult time in my life. The author shares his insights on the 
    importance of courage and optimism in overcoming challenges and achieving success. He highlights the fact that luck alone is not enough to succeed, but 
    rather it is the combination of courage, perseverance, and a positive mindset that ultimately leads to success. This book was a source of inspiration 
    for me and helped me to stay motivated and focused during a challenging period in my life.</p>

  <h2>Sci-fi Movie Enthusiast</h2>
  <p>I absolutely love science fiction films and the way they transport me to other worlds and challenge my imagination. My favorite science fiction film of 
    all time is Interstellar. The film's themes of exploration, time, and love resonated deeply with me, and the visual effects and musical score were simply 
    breathtaking. I have lost count of how many times I have watch3ed it, but every time I do, it feels like a new experience. Watching Interstellar makes me feel 
    both small and infinite at the same time, and I find myself contemplating the mysteries of the universe long after the credits have rolled.</p>
